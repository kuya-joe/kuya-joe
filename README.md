Hello, I'm Kuya Joe! 

I'm a web developer, speaker, and tech community leader. Started out as a php developer working with a littke known cms - [phpwcms](http://www.phpwcms.org/),  

I eventually learned frontend web development and thought I liked it enough to go deep dive in it. And CSS is crazy! But still fine (especially the flex and grid stuff).Now I'm a fullstack-ish javascript developer. (People have different definitions of fullstack).
