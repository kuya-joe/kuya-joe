Hello, I'm Kuya Joe P.! 

I'm a web developer, speaker, and tech community leader. From my roots as a PHP developer working with PHP5 OOP and [phpwcms](http://www.phpwcms.org/),  I learned web development and since most of my tasks were frontend bugs, I learned enough to specialize into becoming a fullstack javascript developer. 

I try to keep up with frontend technology,  especially since it keeps changing every few years. Here's the top programming languages I use.
