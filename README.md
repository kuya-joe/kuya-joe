Hello, I'm Kuya Joe (yep, it's Joe Palala)! I'm a web developer, speaker, and tech community leader. From my roots as a PHP developer (PHPWCMS, anyone?) I learned the basics and eventually landed into frontend. I try to keep up with frontend technology,  especially since it keeps changing every few years.
